Line P Program
---------------------
Ocean Station Papa, situated at 50°N, 145°W, was operated as an ocean weather station starting in December 1949. At that time, the weatherships were occupying Station Papa, and they kept doing so until 1981. After the withdrawal of the weatherships in 1981 the Line P/Station P Program was taken over by the Institute of Ocean Sciences from Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).

Data from BC lightstations
-----------------------------
Daily sea surface temperature and salinity observations have been carried out at several locations on the coast of British Columbia since the early part of the 20th century. Observations started at the Pacific Biological Station (Departure Bay) in 1914; 11 stations were added in the mid-1930s and several more in the 1960s. The number of stations reporting at any given time has varied as sampling has been discontinued at some stations, and started or resumed at others.
